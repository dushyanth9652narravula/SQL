## Introduction to Databases and SQL

- In today's world, many companies such as banking, insurance, ecommerce companies will generate a lot of data everyday. At start they actually used to store in text files. Later they started using Excel spreadsheets, to store data in a formatted way.

- But as days going on, companies are generating massive amount of data (such as customer data, product data, sales data etc). In order to store these massive amount of data, companies needs to replicate same kind of files multiple times. So storing the data, isn't a problem for them. When they are trying to retrieve or perform analysis on that data it becoming a problem for them. Because they have to lookup for many files to get the data they actually need.

- So to overcome these issues with files, companies stated using Databases to store their data. A Database is nothing but a container to store data in an organized way. A Database stores data in well organized way and makes the data more secure. In filesystem, if you want to analyze or query the data we have to lookup all the files and aggreates them manually. But in Database, we have a seperate language called SQL (Structured Query Language) to query the data stored in the database.
